    "# Homework Assignment: Chaining API Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course:** Introduction to Data Science\n",
    "**Topic:** Working with Web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In class, we learned how to send an API request with parameters and authentication. In this assignment, we will take it a step further: **chaining API requests**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Mission:** Write a script that takes a country's name (e.g., \"France\"), automatically finds its capital city (e.g., \"Paris\"), and then fetches the *current* weather for that capital city.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will use two different APIs:\n",
    "1.  **REST Countries**: To find the capital of a country (no key required).\n",
    "2.  **OpenWeatherMap**: To get the weather in a city (requires the API key you generated in class).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a graded assignment. You must fill in the missing code in the `Your Turn` cells and submit the notebook with all outputs visible and correct."
